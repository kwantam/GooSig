- Let G be a group of unknown order with no known low-order elements.
- Let g,h in G be two generators with an unknown discrete log relation.


* SendTokens(pk):   to send tokens to an RSA public key pk=(n,e) do:
  step 1:  generate a random 256-bit s' and set  s = H(s').
           Here H is a hash function that outputs a 2048-bit integer.

  step 2:  output  (C0, C1)  where
           C0 = RSAencrypt(pk, s')  in Z_n
           C1 = g^n * h^s  in G

  note: as described, the magnitude of C0 leaks information about n.
    Instead of simply reducing mod n, the algorithm must do the following:
        repeat:
            - choose a random r in {0,1,...,2^4104//n}
            - compute  C0 = (s^e mod n) + r*n  in Z
        until  (C0 < 2^4104)
        output C0 in Z
    this process ensures that C0 is uniform in {0,1,...,2^4104-1}
    and is independent of n, as long as n is at most 4096 bits.

  another note: while C1 is on the blockchain, C0 can be off chain.
        There is a public association between C0 and pk (e.g., via a hash
        table), so that the owner of pk can easily find C0.  One can
        include H(C1) in the plaintext encrypted in C0 to help the owner
        of pk quickly find C1.


* Sign(sk, (C0,C1), m):  to withdraw the funds associated with (C0,C1)
  by signing a message m using the RSA secret key sk do:

  step 1:  Use sk to decrypt C0 and obtain s'.  Compute s = H(s').
           Then  C1 = g^n * h^s in G.

  step 2:  choose a random prime 2 <= t <= 1000  s.t. t is a quadratic residue mod n.

  step 3:  find integers (w,a) such that   w^2 = t + a*n
           (i.e. w is sqrt(t) mod n)

  step 4:  choose a random 2048-bit integer s1 and compute
           C2 = g^w * h^(s1) in G

  step 5:  choose a random 2048-bit integer s2 and compute
           C3 = g^a * h^(s2) in G

  With (C2, C3, t) public, the computed signature is a
  signature of knowledge of integers (n, w, a, s, s1, s2) where
    (1)  C1 = g^n h^s in G,
    (2)  C2 = g^w h^(s1) in G,
    (3)  C3 = g^a h^(s2) in G,
    (4)  w^2 = t + a*n.

  The ZKPK works by proving knowledge of eight integers
      w, w2, s1, a, an, s1w, sa, s2
  satisfying:
     C2 = g^w h^(s1)
     C3 = g^a h^(s2)
     g^(w2) h^(s1w) = C2^w
     g^(an) h^(sa) = C1^a
     w2 = t + an

  Concretely:
    (i) choose eight random 2048-bit integers
            r_w, r_w2, r_s1, r_a, r_an, r_s1w, r_sa, r_s2

    (ii) compute
            A = g^(r_w)  h^(r_s1)
            B = g^(r_a)  h^(r_s2)
            C = g^(r_w2) h^(r_s1w) / C2^(r_w)
            D = g^(r_an) h^(r_sa)  / C1^(r_a)
            E = r_w2 - r_an   in the integers

    (iii) computes
            PRNG_Key = Hash(G, g, h, C1, C2, C3, t, A, B, C, D, E, m)

    (iv) Use a PRNG seeded with PRNG_Key to generate a random 128-bit chal
         and a random 264-bit prime ell.
     note:  need to check if a Miller-Rabin pseudoprime is sufficient.
     note: ell is a 264-bit prime because there are about 2^256 primes less than 2^264

    (v) compute the integer vector
            z = chal*(w, w2, s1, a, an, s1w, sa, s2) +
                   (r_w, r_w2, r_s1, r_a, r_an, r_s1w, r_sa, r_s2)  in Z^8
        let (z_w, z_w2, z_s1, z_a, z_an, z_s1w, z_sa, z_s2) = z
        and z' = (z mod ell) = (z_w mod ell, z_w2 mod ell, ..., z_s2 mod ell)  in Z^8

    (vi) compute  (here  x // y  is the integer quotient of x divided by y)
            Aq = g^(z_w  // ell)  h^(z_s1  // ell) in G
            Bq = g^(z_a  // ell)  h^(z_s2  // ell) in G
            Cq = g^(z_w2 // ell)  h^(z_s1w // ell)  /  C2^(z_w // ell) in G
            Dq = g^(z_an // ell)  h^(z_sa  // ell)  /  C1^(z_a // ell) in G
            Eq = (z_w2 - z_an) // \ell   in the integers

    (vii) output the signature sig = (C2, C3, t, chal, ell, Aq, Bq, Cq, Dq, Eq, z')



* Verify(C1, m, sig):
    verify that sig is a valid Schnorr signature using
    public key C1 on the message (m, C1, C2, C3).

    (1) Compute
            A = Aq^ell g^(z'_w)  h^(z'_s1)  / C2^(chal)
            B = Bq^ell g^(z'_a)  h^(z'_s2)  / C3^(chal)
            C = Cq^ell g^(z'_w2) h^(z'_s1w) / C2^(z'_w)
            D = Dq^ell g^(z'_an) h^(z'_sa)  / C1^(z'_a)
            E = Eq * ell + ((z'_w2 - z'_an) mod ell) - t * chal
            PRNG_Key = Hash(G, g, h, C1, C2, C3, t, A, B, C, D, E, m)

    (2) Use a PRNG seeded with PRNG_Key to generate chal' and ell'
        as described in step (iii) and (iv) of sign.

    note:  since ell is included in the signature, the verifier
           does not need to search for a prime, but can instead
           verify that the given ell is prime and is not too far
           from the base starting point of the prime search.

    (3) Accept iff chal' == chal and ell' == ell.




### Comments ###

1. There is a seemingly simpler method to prove that one knows the
   factorization of n, namely, prove that one knows p such that p
   divides n.  That is, instead of committing to "w" we would commit
   to "p" and then prove that the committed value divides n. But we
   would also need to prove that the committed factor is not one of
   {1, -1, n, -n}, and that will result in a longer proof.

2. RSAGroupOps implements the quotient group (Z/n)/{1,-1},
   representing elements as |x| = min(x, n - x). This is because the
   proof method requires that no one knows an element of low order
   other than the identity in the group of unknown order.  But for
   Z/n, -1 is such an element. By quotienting out {1,-1}, -1 becomes
   the identity (since min(n - 1, (n + 1) mod n) == 1).

3. This document was updated January 6, 2019 (commit c5c91e8),
   adding step 5 in the signing process (C3, a commitment to 'a'),
   plus extra elements in the signature, etc. Corresponding code
   updates are marked with a short explanatory comment starting
   with 'UPDATE 2019 Jan 06'.

   Note that a verifier for the prior version of the protocol can
   check a signature for the new version by ignoring the two new
   group elements in the signature (informally, this is complete
   but not sound). A new signer can help backward compatibility
   by serializing the signature such that the new group elements
   fall at the end. Schematically, write:

       sig_new = (C2, t, chal, ell, Aq, Cq, Dq, Eq, z', C3, Bq)

   Now, if a verifier for the prior version of the protocol ignores
   the last two elements during deserialization and applies the old
   verification procedure, it will accept valid signatures made
   using the new protocol.

4. This repository was updated January 7, 2020 (commit 364180f),
   changing the length of the prime challenge ell from 136 bits
   (i.e., 2^128 possible primes) to 264 bits (i.e., 2^256 possible
   primes). This addresses security loss that occurs as a result of
   the Fiat-Shamir transform. For more information on the security
   loss, see Section 3.3 of
